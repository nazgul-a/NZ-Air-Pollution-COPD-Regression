# Air Pollution & COPD (NZ): Simple Regression in R

This project provides a **baseline regression** of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) cases in New Zealand as a function of **population**. It focuses on clear statistical communication: estimating the slope with **confidence intervals**, checking **residual diagnostics**, and interpreting the relationship.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- **Source:** NZAir.csv (population vs. COPD cases)
- **Target:** COPD cases  
- **Predictor:** Population

## ðŸ”§ Methods
- Simple Linear Regression (COPD ~ Population)
- 95% Confidence Interval for slope
- Residual analysis & model diagnostics (QQ plot, residuals vs fitted, leverage)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights  
- COPD cases increase proportionally with population growth.  
- About 1 extra case occurs per 5,000 additional people (on average).  
- The model confirms a strong positive relationship between population and COPD cases.  

## ðŸš€ Skills Demonstrated  
- Simple regression modeling with R  
- Statistical interpretation in a health context  
- Communicating applied results  

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- R, R Markdown
- Base R plotting & diagnostics
